## **üìë Overview**
This is a mod for [Minecraft] [Forge].<br>
It's a port of the [LazyAE2] mod for modern [Minecraft] versions .

It adds some useful processing machines to make your [Applied Energistics 2][ae2] experience a little easier especially in the late game.

[Applied Energistics 2][ae2] is a dependency for this mod.


## **üîß Installation**
1. Download the latest **mod jar** from the [releases] or from [curseforge].
2. Install Minecraft [Forge].
3. Install the dependency mod [Applied Energistics 2][ae2].
4. Drop the **jar file** into your mods folder.


## **üêõ BETA**
Since this is our first 1.16 mod, it's still in Beta and there are probably some things which need adjustments or refining.

This mod currently only includes the processing machines. There are some things left from the original mod which are not included yet.

We decided to release it anyways because we need the feedback of players in order to improve the mod and many players asked us to release a Beta version.

Although it went through extensive testing, there could still be bugs and issues. Make sure to report them [here][issues].


## **‚úã Usage**
Most aspects of the mod are pretty self-explanatory.

If you want to know more of the functionlity of the mod as well as a detailed explanation of the
UI elements of the processing machines, check out the functionality guide right [here][functionality].


## **üì¶ Packmakers**
Feel free to use this mod in any modpack.<br>
Credits are not required but always appreciated.

The mod has [CraftTweaker] and [KubeJS] support which you can use to adjust recipes.

You can see everything you need to know about that [here][packmakers].


## **üìï History**
This is a port of the [LazyAE2] mod by [phantamanta44][author].

He didn't update his mod for newer versions because he is only modding for versions he is actively playing.

We ported the mod with his permission.

Since a lot of stuff changed in modern versions of [Minecraft] since 1.12, it's basically a rewrite but still follows the main ideas of the original mod with some exceptions.


## **üìë Credits**
Credits for the original mod and the idea behind it of course go to [phantamanta44][author].<br>
Most of the textures were taken from the original mod.

Texture overhauls have been done by us, [scooperlive][artist1] and [birb/crydigo][artist2].<br>
Further credits of course go to our [contributors].

Everything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].
